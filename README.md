# My React Portfolio

## Description
In order to showcase my best work to future employers and give them a sense of my personality, I have created a webpage using React that can be easily viewed from any device. My portfolio contains navigation links that take users to each page, such as "About", "Portfolio" and "Contact".

The hero section clearly shows my name and a brief subtitle. In the footer section there are clear icons that link to my social profiles, as well as my email address that when clicked, opens the user's email editor to email me.

My portfolio works also showcases the title of each project, so it is clear what the project was. Each project also links to the deployed application for ease of viewing.


## Usage

Users that visit my portfolio website are able to read my brief "About Me", view my headshot, navigate to various methods of contacting me, and browse my previous projects. The navigation bar links to the different pages of my portfolio. In the footers, users can see and click on different social profile icons, find my email address, and navigate through the page.
